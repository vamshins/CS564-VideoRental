## Movie Rental Database System :
=============================

Our web application is built using PHP, HTML as front end, MySQL as backend. We have used local installation of MySQL as database instead of UNM database.

There are two type of roles in the Movie Rental System. They are: 
	1) Administrator 
		He can add/update a movie in the database. The details of the movie include Genre, Medium, etc.
		He can add new exemplar details and link that exemplar to the movie created.
		He can also update his profile information if needed.
	
	2) Customer
		He can search for a movie and place order for a movie if the movie is currently available to buy.
		He can update his profile information if needed.
		He can view all his past orders placed till date.
